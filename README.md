## Implementation Note
All key features and techniques described in the Methodology section of my thesis—such as lazy loading for memory efficiency, multi-GPU distributed training, chunk-based feature extraction, and multiple segmentation options (including HDBSCAN, KNN graph, and KMeans clustering)—are fully implemented in this codebase. This repository contains the actual code used for large-scale experiments and results reported in the thesis.

## Results

The full set of experiment results, including output files and visualizations for the **Lund 50** and **Lund 1196** datasets, is available at:

[View Results on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sjZK4Xjwd6-ITdUM-L1--fAi9wwsNfLI?usp=drive_link)

All 3D results can be visualized using the [PlayCanvas Model Viewer](https://playcanvas.com/model-viewer).
