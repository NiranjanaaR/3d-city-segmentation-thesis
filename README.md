**CityGaussian_v2 + SAGA:** Thesis Experiments
This repository accompanies my master’s thesis and demonstrates experiments using CityGaussian_v2 and SAGA (Segment Any Gaussian).

**Implementation Note**
All key features and techniques described in the Methodology section of my thesis—such as lazy loading for memory efficiency, multi-GPU distributed training, chunk-based feature extraction, and multiple segmentation options (including HDBSCAN, KNN graph, and KMeans clustering)—are fully implemented in this codebase. This repository contains the actual code used for large-scale experiments and results reported in the thesis.

**Results**
The results folder contains output files and visualizations for:
Lund 50 dataset
Lund 1196 dataset
These results can be viewed using the PlayCanvas Model Viewer.

Acknowledgements
This project builds on CityGaussian_v2 and SAGA.
AI tools such as ChatGPT and Grammarly were used for language and code refinement.
